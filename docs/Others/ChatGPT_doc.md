风起于青萍之末

The actual completion you see may differ because the API is non-deterministic by default. This means that you might get a slightly different completion every time you call it, even if your prompt stays the same. Setting temperature to 0 will make the outputs mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variability may remain.

This simple text-in, text-out interface means you can "program" the model by providing instructions or just a few examples of what you'd like it to do. Its success generally depends on the complexity of the task and quality of your prompt. A good rule of thumb is to think about how you would write a word problem for a middle schooler to solve. A well-written prompt provides enough information for the model to know what you want and how it should respond.
